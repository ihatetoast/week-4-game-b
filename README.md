# Get In My Belly RPG
Get In My Belly is modified from the Star Wars RPG. I don't know enough Star Wars to come up with four characters who would be willing to fight each other. No way was I going to pit Leia against Chewy. The only thing I could think of that would be equal (to me) would be desserts. 

The pie, ice cream, doughnut, and waffle will all fight to be the lucky one to get in my belly!
